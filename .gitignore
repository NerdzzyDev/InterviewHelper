# Environments (pipenv)
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598 and pypa/pipenv#1590,
#   pipenv creates the virtualenv in the project root.
#   That's why we need to include above patterns as well.
#   Also, note that there are reports that pipenv might create
#   it in the home directory (~/.local/share/virtualenvs/).
#   Thus, you might want to add `~/.local/share/virtualenvs`
#   to your .gitignore as well.
